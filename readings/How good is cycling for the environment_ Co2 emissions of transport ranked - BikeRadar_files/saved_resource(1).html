class="post-message " data-role="message" dir="auto"><div><p>I doubt I'm an exception to the rule on this matter, but when I had a car, there were so many short trips I was using it for which since 2012 I now know could have been done by bike because all we've had since then besides public transport and walking. It seems crazy thinking back to all those 5 mile commutes each way I used to do, while we have a shopping precinct including a supermarket less than 10mins walk away. Not having a car does have its negatives, such as expensive train tickets to limited easy destinations compared to driving, but cycling more had a number of positives for me over the past ~9 years and it fits in so much better with my general "middle aged eco-warrior hippy" outlook these days.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a

That's a good point - perhaps the battery will not last that long. There are so many variables to consider and that is a good example of one i didn't think of until now. Perhaps the ECF took account of it in their original paper, but I'm not sure.</p><p>It's worth bearing in mind that batteries can (and in the future probably will) be recycled. Their manufacture takes a lot of energy and rare-earth materials, but these materials can, theoretically, be used indefinitely. The above LCAs (for electric cars and bikes) assume a single-use life cycle.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden"

What about cycling clothing (Lycra, clip-in shoes, helmet, etc) versus office/casual wear? I raise these things because none of them (clean drinking water and cycling clothing) are required when driving a car or traveling on public transport.</p><p>In any case, it's great to see the

you!</p><p>Those are factors i didn't consider, and there are many more besides. The more you look into a topic like this, the more complex it becomes.</p><p>It's worth keeping in mind that I've assumed every extra calorie burned is an extra calorie eaten, which is a worst-case scenario for human-powered activities. I think it's a reasonable assumption for cycling, but perhaps not for walking short trips.</p><p>I do think that in the UK we take cycle-commuting a bit too seriously, with our Lycra, clipless pedals and high-vis everything. It makes cycling to work look like a very serious and expensive undertaking, for experienced cyclists only. The media's obsession with how dangerous cycling can be (despite cyclists living longer on average due to the cardiovascular benefits) puts people off too. I like how in Holland or Denmark, if you want to travel somewhere within 10km, you just get on your bike without thinking and go.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul

Lycra, clipless etc are gimmicks when it comes to short-distance commuting. On a related note I've done the exercise, so to speak, to find out whether there would be a <i>time</i> saving on my 7km o/w commute by not changing into cycling clothes but instead riding slower but in office clothes (notwithstanding rainy days), avoiding changing time and dealing with sweat. It was surpisingly hard to determine which was better, which suggests that if the commute were shorter (e.g. 5km), the regular clothes/slower speed option would almost certainly win out, in my case anyway. Adding to that the carbon benefits of reducing bike specific gear would raise that distance further. Your mileage will vary of course, so do some experimenting to find out!</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden"

To be as green as possible, it would mean making sure they are all recycled and possibly that standards for metal extraction improve. Sure, pollution would be lower in areas where such batteries are in use (better air quality), but this currently involves a massive soil pollution during extraction of lithium carbonate. It uses a lot of water in areas where it is in dire need, plus toxic waste leaking from the mines. Same for cobalt, one of the worst polluting metal during extraction. <br>Wired UK made an interesting article about it: ''The spiralling environmental cost of our lithium battery addiction''.</p></div></div><span class="post-media"><ul data-role="post-media-list"></ul></span></div></div><a class="see-more hidden" title="see more" data-action="see-more">see
